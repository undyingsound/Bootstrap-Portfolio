        <p class="lead m-2">When I was young, I wanted to be the next Dave Grohl. I have an ear for music composition and a drive like no other.
            This propelled me into school music programs as well as joining or starting bands with anyone that could play
            an instrument. Unfortunately, I have not yet been indicted into the Music Hall of Fame, but I did become an awesome
            drummer in the process. However, it is time to find a new careerpath. Rockstar life seems boring anyway...
        </p>
        <p class="lead m-2">After working every position in the restaurant industry, I started to get into IT in my early 20s. My parents always
            wanted me to get into the field because it is lucrative and it is ever changing. I started off with doing help
            desk and customer service. I found my voice and my desire to help people and solve problems. I quickly climbed
            the ladder in each position and made incredible connections. Even though I was comfortable, there was always
            a lack of creativity in my roles which led to boredom and a desire to get more out of this life.
        </p>
        <p class="lead m-2">I started looking into web devlopment and I quickly realized that this discipline encompasses all the different areas
            I am trying to harness. I have the ability to combine creative solutions to complex problems both visually and
            logically. I am excited to see where this journey takes me.
