            <p class="lead m-2">When I was young, I wanted to be the next Dave Grohl. I have an ear for music composition and a drive like no
                other. This propelled me into school music programs as well as joining or starting bands with anyone that
                could play an instrument. Unfortunately, I have not yet been indicted into the Music Hall of Fame, but I
                did become an awesome drummer in the process. However, it is time to find a new careerpath. Rockstar life
                seems boring anyway...
            </p>
            <p class="lead m-2">After working every position in the restaurant industry, I started to get into IT in my early 20s. My parents
                always wanted me to get into the field because it is lucrative and it is ever changing. I started off with
                doing help desk and customer service. I found my voice and my desire to help people and solve problems. I
                quickly climbed the ladder in each position and made incredible connections. Even though I was comfortable,
                there was always a lack of creativity in my roles which led to boredom and a desire to get more out of this
                life.
            </p>
            <p class="lead m-2">I started looking into web devlopment and I quickly realized that this discipline encompasses all the different
                areas I am trying to harness. I have the ability to combine creative solutions to complex problems both visually
                and logically. I am excited to see where this journey takes me.
            </p>
